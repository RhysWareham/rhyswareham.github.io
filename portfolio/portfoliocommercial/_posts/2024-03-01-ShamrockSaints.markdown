project-date: January 2023 - November 2023
role: Lead Game Developer
language: TypeScript
description: The first game in industry which I led as Lead Developer from start until release, working alongside a team of Artists, Animators, QA's, Server Developers and Mathematicians at Push Gaming. Prior to this project I had only 4 months experience of TypeScript and Push Gaming's in-house tools and codebase. A beta demo of this game can be played <a href="https://www.bigwinboard.com/shamrock-saints-push-gaming-slot-review/"><FONT color="#0000ff">HERE</FONT></a> 
contribution: My role was to implement all mechanics and features, as well as to ensure that the game responded correctly to server data and would load to the correct state at any point that the user disconnected from the game (on purpose or due to internet issues). <br><br>Mechanics Implemented: <ul><li>Base Spins</li><li>Nudging Mystery Reels (where seaweed symbols must only move down 1 position before revealing a symbol)</li><li>Chest Symbol with Multiple Prize Shuffle and Selection</li><li>Bonus Game plays until no Mystery Symbols on the grid (where the All Wins multiplier is increased with each spin)</li><li>Collectible Tokens (to eventually break the pot and trigger Swarm Mode)</li><li>Golden Leprechaun Reels</li><li><li>Collector Symbols</li><li>Multiplier Symbols</li><li>Instant Coins (instant prize of bet multiplied by number on coin)</li></li>
summary: Shamrock Saints is a new slot game by Push Gaming
