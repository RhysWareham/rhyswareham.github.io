description: Spacebased is a multiplayer party racing game where players construct their own cars. The game is split up into 2 stages.<br>The first is the construction stage where players are given 4 different part types to construct their cars (Wheels, Car Bodies, Engines and Turbos), each of these parts have 4 different quality options (Poor, Okay, Good, Epic), these qualities cannot be seen by players until parts are fitted to the car. Players have a limited amount of time to put these parts on their car before taking them into the race.<br>The race has the 4 players compete against each other with their different car part qualities influencing different aspects of the car (Handing, Boost, Max Speed, Acceleration etc.).

contribution: I was the only programmer in a group of 3 game design students and myself and the project was completed in 8 months. While I did not have to make a large design contribution, I had a significant amount of work to implement the planned features within the given deadlines. I also had to manage all of the asset importing into the unity project as none of my other team members had experience with Unity.<br><br>Mechanics Implemented<ul><li>Player Movement (Custom Player Walking (Construction Stage)​, Custom Driving Mechanics (Race Stage))</li><li>Part Fitting on to cars​ - Converting parts in boxes into data and 3d models for car parts</li><li>Part Fitting Minigame</li><li>Part Quality System - Part Quality having an effect on car properties</li><li>Conveyor Belt System</li><li>Custom Laps/Checkpoint/Car Position System</li><li>Custom Car Respawn System</li><li>Scene Transitions</li><li>Music and Ambient Audio System</li><li>Character Selection System</li></ul>
