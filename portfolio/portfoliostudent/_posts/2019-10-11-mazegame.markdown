description: For my first University Assignment, I was tasked to demonstrate simple level design and programming techniques in order to add interactive mechanics to a basic game, using the Unity games engine. As there was no detail on what sort of game it must be, I decided to stick with a simple maze idea in order to implement random mechanics with it still suiting the genre.
summary: Simple maze game created in Unity
contribution: As I worked on this project alone, I had to do each aspect personally; planning, programming, level design and asset building/sourcing.<br><br>Mechanics Implemented<ul><li>Main Menu</li><li>Options Menu (Adjustable Screen Resolution)</li><li>Walking and Jumping</li><li>Opening and Closing Doors</li><li>Locked Doors with Collectable Keys</li><li>Teleportation</li><li>Time Lasers which Respawn the Player if Touched</li><li>Collapsible Pathway</li><li>Pop-up Hints</li></ul>
