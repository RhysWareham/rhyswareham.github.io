language: C# (Unity)
description: Battle Babies is a 2-dimensional multiplayer fighting game. For this project we were put into a group of 3; two games programmers and one games designer, and was given 4 months to make a "party game." The game consists of 4 characters with different abilities, as well as 4 maps and various pickups. The aim of the game is to attack the other players and become the last player alive. Battle Babies was built using the Unity Engine.
contribution: Being the lead programmer, I had the task of coding the movement, implementing the animations and added extra mechanics within the game. I also had to manage the rest of the team, making sure everyone was communicating well, and on track with their tasks in order to ensure the game would be finished by the set deadline.
