description: For my first University Assignment, I was tasked to recreate a classic arcade/retro game using a provided engine in C++. The provided engine included functionality to draw and move sprites as well as creating windows, all of the game logic programmings was completed by myself.  The project required OOP principles to be followed as well as programming standards around variable, class and function naming. This gave me my first insight and attempt at creating a product that reached industry standards of programming.<br>The recreation includes most of the features present in the original game including score, asteroids breaking up when shot, lives and UFOs.
