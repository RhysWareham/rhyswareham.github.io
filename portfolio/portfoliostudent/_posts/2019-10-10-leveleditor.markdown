description: In this assignment I was tasked to create a Level Editor. The requirements for this, were to be able to import and split up a tilemap, place and delete sprites on an extendable grid, and save/load "drawings". This was the first time using two different programming languages simultaneously. In XAML, I had to program and design the layout of the window of which the user would navigate through the available sprites, and choose which tools to use.
summary: Program which allows the user to draw and erase levels
contribution: Being the only programmer on this assignment, I had to do all coding and design myself. <br><br>Mechanics implemented<ul><li>Loading Sprites from a Tilemap</li><li>Scrollbar to Browse Available Sprites</li><li>Drawing on a Grid with a Specific Sprite</li><li>Erasing Specific Sprites</li><li>Saving Files</li><li>Loading Files</li><li>Extendable Grid</li></ul>
