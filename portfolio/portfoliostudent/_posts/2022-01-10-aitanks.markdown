description: For this project, I was tasked with creating two types of AI. This was my first time programming AI, and led to new found interest in games programming for myself. The blue tank uses a behaviour tree for their AI, and actively searches for the Red, scouting their last known positions if the target manages to hide. Whereas the red tank uses a State Machine and tries to sneak up on the Blue, and is able to find cover when realising they have been spotted.
