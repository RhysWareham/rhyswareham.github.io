description: This project was my output design as a part two of my final year research assignment. Since I have always had an interest in puzzles, I focused on the Use of Procedural Generation for Puzzles in Video Games, whereby the main conclusion being that it can lead to a much higher rate of replayability for a player wishing to reexperience a story/game. To backup my research I designed and developed a puzzle where a player is given a grid of pillars. Each pillar has a hole with part of a number. By rotating the pillars, the player is able to align number parts to reveal the numbers required for a code to unlock the door. The grid is randomised from 2 by 2, to 7 by 7 pillars. The code is randomised from 2 to 9 digits long. And the numbers are always split up and scattered randomly amongst the grid of pillars. There are also difficulty options of Easy, Medium and Hard to give as large a sense of replayability as possible.
