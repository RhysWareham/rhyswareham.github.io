description: For an experimental games module, my team and I decided to make a vr game in which a player would play as a blind person. The objective was to complete a series of household chores to get ready for work. The player is able to get a sense of where they are via a shader which produced sonar like waves across surfaces based on sound created within game. Objects could create a sound wave from being dropped or hit against a surface; there were also radios around the house to give some base sound visuals.
contribution: This was the first game I had worked on for VR compatability. My contribution included: <br><ul><li>Player Movement</li><li>Level Designing</li><li>Player Interactions and Tasks</li>
