description: For this small project I had to program a way to load a MD2 model, along with its animations. On top of that, I had to map the given texture, to the model throughout the animation. I then was tasked to create a maze of blocks, which were able to be randomised when clicking a button. After programming each of these features, I had to implement the A-Star pathfinding algorithm, in order to allow the model to make its way around the maze to a chosen point on the grid.
summary: MD2 Model Loader and Pathfinder
contribution: I was given a very simple starting project as it was the first time using OpenGL, but the features included in the assignment, were all programmed by myself. <br><br>Mechanics implemented<ul><li>MD2 Model Loading</li><li>MD2 Texture Mapping (Changable Textures)</li><li>MD2 Animations</li><li>Randomising Maze from Key Input</li><li>Pathfinding Around Maze</li></ul>
