description: Kurat has been developed by myself and 4 team members for our final university project. The game has been taken to Insomnia 68 where we gathered over 1000 playtesters and a large amount of feedback. Kurat is an action board game for up to 4 players, in which the players must make decisions as a team and survive a variety of trials supplied by the Devil. Weapons are physics based using the right analog stick to control; for example you must swing a scythe around the player to gather momentum to deal higher damage. Should any team member die, the whole group loses.
contribution: Within this project, I primarily focused on the physics based combat system and the enemy AI.<br><br>Implementations<br><ul><li>Using the right analog stick of a controller, the player can swing around their character; using the speed of the swing the game calculates the exact force and damage that the player character deals to the enemy and in which direction. </li><li>By pulling back the right analog stick, the character can pull back the sting of a bow and aim in the direction to be released; the further back the stick has been pulled, the further and stronger the arrow will fly. </li><li>On top of this, I worked on the major enemies within the game, such as the Frog of the North and the Ancestors. Some of these enemy attacks are displayed in the GIFs below.</li></ul>
