description: Kurat has been developed by myself and 4 team members for our final university project. The game has been taken to Insomnia 68 where we gathered over 1000 playtesters and a large amount of feedback. Kurat is an action board game for up to 4 players, in which the players must make decisions as a team and survive a variety of trials supplied by the Devil. Weapons are physics based using the right analog stick to control; for example you must swing a scythe around the player to gather momentum to deal higher damage. Should any team member die, the whole group loses.
contribution: Within this project, I primarily focused on the physics based combat system in which the player uses the right analog stick of a controller to swing a weapon around their character, or pull back to aim a bow. On top of this, I worked on the major enemies within the game, such as the Frog of the North and the Ancestors. Some of these enemy attacks are displayed in the GIFs below.
