description: This is a project that I have started in my freetime. When I was in primary school, we were shown a maths game on the internet named Powerline; the idea of the game was to arrange the given numbers on a diagram in order to make all lines equate to the expected result. I have fond memories of this game, though there were only 10 levels or so. I decided that I wanted to use this concept to make a mobile game, in which I could supply countless levels by creating a random generation system. So far I have 100 levels for each of my current 9 pattern types.
contribution: As this is a solo project, I am doing both the design of puzzles and the programming in C#. I have developed a system in which I can set the preferred pattern layout, press play, and generate as many possible puzzles as wanted; as well as a level loading and spawning system.<br><br>Mechanics Implemented<br><ul><li>Movement of number slots</li><li>Checks if rows or columns equate to expected number</li><li>Checks if entire puzzle is solved</li><li>Continuous gameplay loop throughout levels</li><li>Currently 9 different pattern types, with 100 levels each</li></ul>
