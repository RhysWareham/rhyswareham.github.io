description: This is a project that I have started in my freetime. When I was in primary school, we were shown a maths game on the internet named Powerline; the idea of the game was to arrange the given numbers on a diagram in order to make all lines equate to the expected result. I have fond memories of this game, though there were only 10 levels or so. I decided that I wanted to use this concept to make a mobile game, in which I could supply countless levels by creating a random generation system. So far I have 100 levels for each size of "Hollow Square" pattern type, as demonstrated in the video. I have a lot of layouts planned, and also intend to create a timed daily challenge mode.
