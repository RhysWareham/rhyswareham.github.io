description: Kurat has been developed by myself and 4 team members for our final university project. The game has been taken to Insomnia 68 where we gathered over 1000 playtesters and a large amount of feedback. Kurat is an action board game for up to 4 players, in which the players must make decisions as a team and survive a variety of trials supplied by the Devil. Weapons are physics based using the right analog stick to control; for example you must swing a scythe around the player to gather momentum to deal higher damage. Should any team member die, the whole group loses.
summary: Kurat is a co-op action board game inspired by Estonian Mythology
awards: Nominated for TIGA Creative Assembly Best Student Game 2022 Award
contribution: Within this project, I have primarily been working on the items, combat mechanics and enemy AI including the two current boss enemies: The Frog of the North and The 4 Ancestors.
