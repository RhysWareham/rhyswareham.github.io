description: This is a project that I have started in my freetime. I have always been fascinated by perspectives and puzzles, and about 7 years ago when I was in college I had an idea for a platformer in which you could adjust how much the camera can be angled in order to make new clues and items visible from behind walls. I finally decided to make this mechanic into a game. Though it is still just a prototype, I have level designs already drawn out and a development plan ready to follow. I have also been doing the art and modelling for this.
