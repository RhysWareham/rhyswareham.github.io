description: No Signal is a short game created within 30 hours for the University of Gloucestershire Game Jame 2019. My team consisted of 3 Programmers including myself and 2 Designers. The theme of this game jam was "Waves," so my team and I decided to use radio waves as the main mechanic. The game follows a UFO hunter with a radio scanner which he uses to track down his van to enevitably get back home after being abducted. However, when using the scanner, it causes the aliens to try to attack him. <br>This game came in the Top 3 within the main competition, and was then chosen to be shown off at the end of year show, where it placed 2nd overall.
