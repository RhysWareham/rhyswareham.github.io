description: This was my first game jam in which I worked entirely alone for 26 hours, utilising free assets and animations from Mixamo in order to add some character to the game. The theme was "Make Me Laugh". This being the case, I decided to create a small game in which the player must navigate a clown through a circus-themed obstacle course in order to get to the stage. The course randomises on each playthrough, allowing the player to keep trying and attempting the different obstacles. The game is uploaded to Itch.io, <a href="https://warehamgames.itch.io/youre-on-in-5"><FONT color="#0000ff">here</FONT></a>. If the web game does not play well, the build is downloadable from the same page.
summary: You're On In 5 was my first solo game jam
