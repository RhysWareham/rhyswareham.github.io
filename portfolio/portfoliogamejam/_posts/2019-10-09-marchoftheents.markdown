description: Last March of the Ent is a short game created within a 48 hour time frame as part of the Global Game Jam 2023. The team was composed of a designer and myself as programmer. The theme of this project was “Roots”; so we decided to make the player control an Ent digging its roots into the ground in order to fight against gravity, whilst knocking away the Lumberjack's deadly axes. We took inspiration from QWOP for the control scheme.
summary: Myself and a designer developed this small game based on the theme, "Roots"
