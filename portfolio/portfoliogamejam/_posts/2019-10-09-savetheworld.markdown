description: Save The World is a short game created within a 48 hour time frame as part of the Global Game Jam 2020. Our team was composed of 2 Programmers and 3 Designers. The theme of this project was “Repair”; so my team and I thought of an idea in which you play as a character on a space station, and send drones to the nearby planet in order to explore, scavenge and repair the environment. Our initial idea was to be able to repair the drones as they come back to the station as well; but we realised that we had over-scoped, so we decided to just stick to one section of the game.
summary: Save The World was made for the Global Game Jam 2020
contribution: Within this small project, I tasked myself with working on the scripts for each drone; scavenger, worker and explorer. This involved learning the use of classes more in depth, and gaining a stronger understanding of the practical applications of this feature. I also helped with programming the world generation.
