                            I'm Rhys, a Gameplay Programmer who graduated from University of Gloucestershire.<br>
                            Currently working as a Game Developer on slot games at Push Gaming, I am looking to make my way into the mainstream game development industry. 
                            Over the past 9 years of developing my knowledge of programming and software skills, I have found that my main interest is towards Gameplay and AI Programming. I love creating and tweaking the player's interactions to give them the most satisfying experience.
                            <br>The last team indie project that I worked on, Kurat, was nominated for TIGA Creative Assembly Best Student Game Award 2022. But I am now working on two solo projects in Unity, one being a Mobile Maths Puzzle Game, and the other a 2D Metroidvania.<br>
                            The skills of which I have acquired include: <br><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>C#, C++, TypeScript</li>
                                <li>Unity Engine</li>
                                <li>Unreal Engine 4</li>
                                <li>Visual Studio (Community and Code)</li>
                                <li>Adobe Creative Suite</li>
                                <li>Autodesk Maya</li>
                                <li>Perforce, GitHub</li>
                                <li>Confluence, ClickUp, Trello</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>

                            Many of my projects are available to look at below.<br>
