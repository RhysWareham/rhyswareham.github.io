                        <span class="skills">
                            I'm Rhys, an enthusiastic Game Developer currently working at Push Gaming.<br>
                            As lead developer on my first commercial project, “Shamrock Saints” (released on March 5th), I’m thrilled to bring my 9 years of programming and software skills into the gaming world.<br>
			    I have found that my primary interest lies in Gameplay and AI Programming. This interest is highlighted in “Kurat,” a TIGA-nominated indie project developed by myself and 4 others, in which I was dedicated to crafting Player Combat and Enemy AI within the Unity Engine.<br>
                            Along with gaining a First Class Honours BSc in Computer Games Programming from the University of Gloucestershire, I have continuously demonstrated my passion for game development by engaging in multiple game jams as well as my own projects. I am currently working on two solo projects: a Mobile Maths Puzzle Game using Unity and a Third-Person Stealth game in Unreal Engine 5.<br><br>
			    The skills of which I have acquired include: <br><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>C#, C++, TypeScript</li>
                                <li>Unity Engine</li>
                                <li>Unreal Engine 4</li>
                                <li>Visual Studio (Community and Code)</li>
                                <li>Adobe Creative Suite</li>
                                <li>Autodesk Maya</li>
                                <li>Perforce, GitHub</li>
                                <li>Confluence, ClickUp, Trello</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>

                            Many of my projects are available to look at below.<br>
