                        <span class="skills">I am Lewis, a Computer Games Programming student at the University of Gloucestershire. I have also launched a solo space action-adventure game of my own, in September 2019 on Steam.<br>
							Over my time so far as a games programmer, I have already acquired a vast set of skills that I used in and outside of studies. Most of these I have learnt through the development process of my first commercial project, which was funded by Kickstarter in May 2017 as well as various student projects, which you can check out in my portfolio.

							I have profficient skills in the following areas:
							<ul>
								<li>C, C#, C++</li>
								<li>Python</li>
								<li>GML (Game Maker Language)</li>
								<li>HTML, CSS, XAML</li>
								<li>Unity Engine</li>
								<li>Unreal Engine</li>
								<li>Game Maker (Studio and 2)</li>
								<li>Visual Studio (Community and Code)</li>
								<li>Perforce, Git</li>
								<li>Confluence</li>
								<li>Adobe Creative Suite</li>
							</ul>
